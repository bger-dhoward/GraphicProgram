# GraphicProgram
A pyRevit extension for creating a graphic program from an Excel / CSV file.

This extension attempts to automate the creation of a graphical program diagram, using the inputs from a spreadsheet.

Divides rooms by department, creates labels, and draws multiple rooms if needed.

(just playing around to test some git stuff)
